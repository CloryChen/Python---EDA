# Python: Automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Framework for Simulated Shopping Data for PCFI

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a Python-based framework for automating Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a simulated (PCFI) shopping dataset. The framework provides a structured, repeatable approach to understand datasets, uncover patterns, and prepare data for modeling or business decision-making.

## Features
- **Dataset Overview:** Summarizes dataset size, missing values, duplicates, and variable types.
- **Variable Profiling:** Generates statistics (mean, median, skewness) and visualizations (histograms) for each column.
- **Interaction Analysis:** Visualizes relationships between variables to detect dependencies and patterns.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Computes Pearson and Spearman correlations to identify multicollinearity and feature redundancy.
- **Missing Value Visualization:** Highlights missing data and informs decisions for data imputation.
- **Automated Alerts:** Flags potential data quality issues such as high correlations or constant columns.
- **Sample Preview:** Quickly inspects data formatting, types, and potential anomalies.
