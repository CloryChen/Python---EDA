# Python---EDA
This project demonstrates a Python-based framework for automating Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a simulated retail shopping dataset (PCFI). The framework provides a structured, repeatable approach to understand datasets, uncover patterns, and prepare data for modeling or business decision-making.
